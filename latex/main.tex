\begin{abstract}
The rapid evolution of web scraping has led to increasing challenges in extracting structured information from dynamic and complex websites. This thesis presents ScrapegraphAI, a novel open-source library designed to redefine data extraction through Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based architectures. 

The study examines the limitations of traditional web scraping techniques—such as CSS selectors, XPath, and API-based extraction—highlighting their inefficiencies in handling JavaScript-rendered content and evolving anti-bot policies.

ScrapegraphAI  leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and neural architectures to automate web scraping, reducing the dependency on manual scripting while improving accuracy and adaptability. The research evaluates the library's performance against industry-standard tools, measuring efficiency, scalability, and resistance to website obfuscation techniques. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that ScrapegraphAI  achieves superior metadata extraction rates and reduced failure rates in bot-protected environments.

The findings of this thesis suggest that AI-driven scraping paradigms can significantly enhance automation and data accessibility, paving the way for intelligent and resilient web crawlers. Future work will explore multi-agent collaboration, integration with Reinforcement Learning, and real-time document segmentation to optimize large-scale data retrieval.
